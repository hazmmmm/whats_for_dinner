1) pip install PyQt6

2) some people have Error: "ImportError: libEGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
   and some do not. It seems as if it depends on the environment.

3) use Search_Recipe.py to launch GUI → browse to the image → click search recipe

4) after the second window opened you can choose how many recipes you wanna be shown
